Comprehensive README for the Next.js project in this workspace. This document describes the project, the folder structure, how to run it locally, the main technologies used, development tips, and contribution guidelines.

## Quick summary

- Framework: Next.js (app router)
- React version: 19.x
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Linting: ESLint
- Other notable libs: Framer Motion, react-icons, lucide-react, react-google-recaptcha

This project appears to be a marketing/technology comparison site with many static pages and componentized UI in `src/components`.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (recommended)
- npm (or yarn/pnpm if you prefer; examples below use npm)

## Scripts (from package.json)

These are the npm scripts included in the repository's `package.json`:

- npm run dev — run development server (uses Turbopack):

```bash
npm run dev
```

- npm run build — build production assets:

```bash
npm run build
```

- npm run start — start production server after build:

```bash
npm run start
```

- npm run lint — run ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Install

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 (Next.js default) in your browser.

Note: The `app/` directory indicates this project uses Next.js App Router (Next 13+ style). The `src/components` folder contains the site's reusable UI pieces.

## Notable files and folders

- `src/app` — application routes and top-level layout. Pages are organized in subfolders (e.g., `About-Us`, `Software-comparison`).
- `src/components` — shared React components used by pages (forms, navigation, footer, hero, etc.).
- `src/assets` — static assets (images, icons, etc.).
- `public/` — files served statically, such as `site.webmanifest` and images.
- `eslint.config.mjs` / `eslint` devDependency — linting config is present.
- `tailwindcss` and `postcss.config.mjs` — Tailwind appears configured (check `globals.css` and postcss config).

## Development notes & tips

- When adding pages in the App Router, create a folder and a `page.jsx` export for each route.
- Keep reusable UI in `src/components` and prefer props-driven components.
- If you use Tailwind, ensure `globals.css` imports the Tailwind base/components/utilities. Run the dev server to verify JIT builds.
- For local environment variables, create a `.env.local` in the repo root and add variables like NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL — Next.js reads that automatically.

## Testing & linting

- Lint with:

```bash
npm run lint
```

If you add tests (Jest, Testing Library), add scripts and configuration and note them here.

## Deployment

- This is a standard Next.js app: it can be deployed to Vercel with zero config, or to other providers (Netlify, Azure, AWS) that support Next.js. For production builds:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

On Vercel, link the repository and the platform will build using `npm run build` automatically.

## Contribution

1. Fork the repository or create a new branch off `main`.
2. Follow existing code style (JSX, naming, and Tailwind class usage).
3. Run lint and dev server to verify changes.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of changes.

If you want, add a CONTRIBUTING.md for additional standards (commit message style, branch naming, PR checklists).

## Recommended local checks (fast)

```bash
# install deps
npm install

# dev server
npm run dev

# lint
npm run lint
```

## Where to look next (developer onboarding)

- `src/app/layout.jsx` — top-level layout and global wrappers (head, providers, etc.)
- `src/app/globals.css` — global CSS, likely includes Tailwind directives
- `src/components` — check for shared components and examples of usage

## License

Add a license file at the project root (e.g., `LICENSE`) and specify the license here. Example:

```
MIT
```

## A note about this README

This README was generated from the workspace snapshot. If files were added or removed after this generation, run a directory listing to update the file-tree shown above. If you'd like, I can automatically generate a full `tree`-style listing of the repository and insert it into this README.

---

If you'd like changes to the README (more sections, examples, screenshots, or CI/deploy configuration), tell me which parts to expand and I will update it.

## Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` in the repository root for local-only secrets and variables. Do NOT commit this file. Example variables the app may use:

```env
# public-facing API base URL used by client-side code
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com

# server-side secret keys (never exposed client-side)
SECRET_API_KEY=your_secret_here
RECAPTCHA_SECRET=xxxxxxxx
```

Secrets and server-only variables should use names that do NOT start with NEXT_PUBLIC_.

## How to add a new page (App Router)

1. Inside `src/app/` create a folder for the route, e.g. `src/app/features/`.
2. Add a `page.jsx` exporting a React component for the page.

Example `src/app/features/page.jsx`:

```jsx
export default function FeaturesPage() {
	return (
		<main className="py-12 px-6">
			<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Features</h1>
			<p className="mt-4">Describe your product features here.</p>
		</main>
	)
}
```

Use `layout.jsx` files to wrap common UI (header/footer) inside route groups.

## How to add a component

Put shared components under `src/components/` and export them as default or named exports. Keep them small and composable. Example:

```jsx
// src/components/Button.jsx
export default function Button({ children, onClick }) {
	return (
		<button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded" onClick={onClick}>
			{children}
		</button>
	)
}
```

Then import it:

```jsx
import Button from '@/components/Button'

<Button onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>Click me</Button>
```

## Run a production build locally

Build and run locally to test production behavior:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

This starts the server in production mode. Visit http://localhost:3000.

## Docker (optional)

Example `Dockerfile` for running the Next.js app in production:

```dockerfile
# Install dependencies only when needed
FROM node:18-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --production

# Rebuild the source
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build

# Production image, copy built assets and start
FROM node:18-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
COPY --from=builder /app/next.config.mjs ./
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

You can build and run locally with:

```bash
docker build -t the-tech-gafru .
docker run -p 3000:3000 the-tech-gafru
```

## GitHub Actions CI (example)

Add the following workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run lint and build on PRs and pushes to `main`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
	push:
		branches: [ main ]
	pull_request:
		branches: [ main ]

jobs:
	build:
		runs-on: ubuntu-latest
		steps:
			- uses: actions/checkout@v4
			- name: Setup Node
				uses: actions/setup-node@v4
				with:
					node-version: '18'
			- name: Install dependencies
				run: npm ci
			- name: Lint
				run: npm run lint
			- name: Build
				run: npm run build

```

Adjust node version and additional test steps to your needs.

## Deployment notes

- Vercel: connect the GitHub repository and Vercel will use `npm run build` automatically. For App Router and Next.js features, prefer Vercel for first-class support.
- Other hosts (Netlify, Render, AWS): ensure they support Next.js App Router or use their Next.js build plugins.

If you deploy behind a CDN, make sure to configure caching headers for static assets in `public/` and the `.next/static` files.

## Troubleshooting

- Missing Tailwind styles: ensure `globals.css` includes the Tailwind directives `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;` and that `tailwind.config.js` (or Tailwind v4 config) has the right content/scan paths (e.g., `src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`).
- `next dev` fails or port in use: set PORT env var or kill the process using the port.
- Build errors referencing experimental features or plugins: check `next.config.mjs` and `package.json` versions (Next 15 requires matching `eslint-config-next`)

If you hit an error you can't resolve, copy the full stack trace and create an issue/PR with a reproducible step.

## Accessibility & SEO checklist

- Use semantic HTML (main, header, nav, footer, h1-h6) in pages and components.
- Ensure images have descriptive `alt` text.
- Use descriptive link text (avoid "click here").
- Run Lighthouse / Axe locally as part of QA.
- Add meta title/description and Open Graph tags in `layout.jsx` or using Next.js head helpers.

## Changelog & releases

- Keep a `CHANGELOG.md` or use GitHub Releases for tagging versions and release notes.

## Contact / Maintainers

If you need help, open an issue or contact the repository owner (`md-Gafrujama`) via GitHub.
